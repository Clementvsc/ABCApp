# ABCBooks Web-Based Application

## Overview
**ABCBooks** is a robust web-based application designed to efficiently manage book collections. Utilizing a serverless architecture on **AWS**, the application integrates **Amazon DynamoDB** for data persistence, **AWS Lambda** for backend processing, and **Amazon Cognito** for user authentication. This project provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with the book database, enabling users to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Project Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you will have the ability to:
- Develop a static front-end user interface using HTML, JavaScript, or Python hosted on **Amazon S3**.
- Implement serverless backend functionalities using **AWS Lambda** to manage data operations on **DynamoDB**.
- Create and deploy RESTful APIs using **Amazon API Gateway** that interact with Lambda functions.
- Secure the application by integrating **Amazon Cognito** for user authentication and management.
- Deploy a fully operational serverless application on AWS that scales efficiently.

## Application Architecture
The architecture of the ABCBooks application consists of the following components:

1. **Frontend:**
   - A static web application built using HTML and JavaScript (or Python) hosted on **Amazon S3**.
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for all CRUD operations.

2. **Backend:**
   - **AWS Lambda** functions that perform the business logic for book management.
   - **Amazon API Gateway** to create and manage API endpoints that route requests to Lambda functions.

3. **Database:**
   - **Amazon DynamoDB** table that stores book records and allows for quick and efficient data retrieval.

4. **Authentication:**
   - **Amazon Cognito** for user sign-up, sign-in, and session management, ensuring secure access to the application.

## Technologies Used
